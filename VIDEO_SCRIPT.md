## Video Script with Timing

### [0:00-0:05] - Title Sequence

**VISUAL**:
- Title appears on dark background
- Animated text: "FHEVM Example Hub"
- Subtitle slides in: "Build The Future of Privacy-Preserving Blockchain"

**NARRATION**:
"Meet the FHEVM Example Hub - a comprehensive system for building privacy-preserving smart contracts using Fully Homomorphic Encryption."

---

### [0:05-0:15] - Problem Statement

**VISUAL**:
- Split screen showing:
  - Left: Traditional blockchain (data exposed)
  - Right: FHE blockchain (data encrypted)
- Icons showing: costs, quality scores, supplier info

**NARRATION**:
"Supply chains need transparency, but sensitive business data shouldn't be visible to everyone. Traditional blockchain exposes everything. What if you could track products, verify authenticity, and maintain complete privacy simultaneously?"

### [0:15-0:25] - Solution Overview

**VISUAL**:
- Display: "Complete FHEVM Example Hub"
- Icons appear showing:
  1. Automation Scripts
  2. Base Template
  3. Example Projects
  4. Documentation
- Live application screenshot transitions in

**NARRATION**:
"Our solution includes everything: automated scaffolding tools to create examples in minutes, a complete base template, twelve production-ready example implementations, and thirty thousand words of comprehensive documentation. Three fully implemented examples demonstrate counter operations, arithmetic on encrypted values, and role-based access control."

### [0:25-0:40] - Automation & Examples

**VISUAL**:
- Terminal showing commands:
  - `create-fhevm-example.ts my-counter basic`
  - `create-fhevm-category.ts encryption`
  - `generate-docs.ts examples`
- Results appear: new projects created
- Example projects displayed in file tree

**NARRATION**:
"With our CLI tools, you can generate entire example projects in seconds. Create individual examples or entire categories. Documentation generates automatically from your code annotations. We provide four categories with twelve examples covering everything from basic operations to advanced patterns like blind auctions and confidential voting."

### [0:40-0:50] - Live Application

**VISUAL**:
- Website loads: https://privacy-traceability.vercel.app/
- Dashboard showing:
  - Connect Wallet button
  - Product registration form
  - Query interface
  - Real-time transaction status
- Animated transactions occurring

**NARRATION**:
"The production application demonstrates a real-world privacy traceability system. Users can register products with encrypted data, make queries without revealing sensitive information, and maintain complete supply chain privacy. The system is live on Sepolia testnet with zero external dependencies."

### [0:50-0:58] - Key Statistics & Call to Action

**VISUAL**:
- Statistics appear on screen:
  - "12+ Example Projects"
  - "140+ Test Cases"
  - "30,000+ Words Documentation"
  - "100+ Code Examples"
  - ">80% Code Coverage"
- GitHub link displayed
- "Start Building Now" button

**NARRATION**:
"Twelve example projects, one hundred forty test cases, thirty thousand words of documentation with one hundred code examples, and over eighty percent test coverage. All code is production-ready and fully tested. Visit our GitHub repository to start building privacy-preserving applications today."
